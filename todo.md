I have a few goals and ideas and this seems like an ok place to track them.  I'm open to requests or suggestions.  If you've randomly stumbled across this blog and like the way I write, feel free to submit an issue against the repository in github.

## writing
 - With a focus on the less technical members, write articles on SDLC, SCM, deployments, environments, etc.  The idea being to help them figure out some of the complexities of what we do so they can make more informed and realistic decisions.
 - Series on load testing
 - Series on customizing shell and becoming a terminal warrior.

## blog itself
 - fix https vs http issues
 - redesign?
