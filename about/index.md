About 

In the past, I've done work with MSU libraries and Cornell University. This is not affiliated with either of those organizations. This is a personal blog for me to publish random technical posts with less friction than a normal blog. Views expressed here are my own.

I work in whatever language is needed at the time, but prefer Javascript and PHP right now. Current interests are devops and functional programming.
